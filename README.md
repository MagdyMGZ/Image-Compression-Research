# Image - Compression Research Abstract

As mass media becomes an integral part of daily life, so does visual media. Optimizing how we store and transmit images is heavily related to the process of image compression. The prospect of processing images with reduced costs has been garnering a lot of attention over an extended period of time and more so recently. 
Our research aims to find an optimized compression algorithm using wavelets, which solves the two main issues which face the compression process. The first issue, which is the formation of “blocking artifacts”, was remedied by utilizing wavelets rather than other transforms like the DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform). 
The second issue of finding the ideal balance between image quality and compression was solved by utilizing the use of thresholding and setting the value of the threshold to the value of standard deviation of the image used. Using that method produces compression ratios up to 180 times greater than lossless compression while only losing 0.03% of the 
original signal’s energy.
